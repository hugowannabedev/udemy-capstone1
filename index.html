    <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            As a recent graduate from Ironhack Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, 
            I've acquired a good foundation in JavaScript,Git, CSS, HTML, React, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and Mongoose. 
            This immersive experience provided me with the opportunity to collaborate with others, 
            solve problems creatively, and develop a passion for building scalable and responsive web applications. 
            I am very excited to apply my new set of skills and continue learning in a dynamic and challenging environment.
